    "Nowadays, it is difficult to imagine a city without a restaurant or a vanue for food where people can have a meal or drink. The city of my choose is Taganrog that is the leading historic, cultural and industrial center in the South of Russia. Local industry and businesses are represented by aerospace, machine-building, military, iron and steel industry, farming, food, theathers, museums and one of the major ports of Azov Sea. That means there are a lot of business opportunities for restaurant business what leads to high competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "To survive in such competitive market it is very important to find right place and take into account many other important factors such as:\n",
    "* City population\n",
    "* Sport And Entertainment zones\n",
    "* Food markets with products of local farmers\n",
    "* Local competitors and their ratings\n",
    "* etc\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce the risks and avoid loss of money, the analisys of all accessible data should be carried out carefully in order to choose a suitable place or location. In my opinion, even an amazing idea or ingenious concept will not make your restaurant business successful without suitable place for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time when someone want to open a cafe or restaurant or similar businesses, the very first question is where to open and how to find such ideal for your business place. Although there are many other important factor that you should take into account, but no ingenious concept will make your business successful without suitable place for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of finding the right place, we should find all existing businesses in the city of interest and explore them carefully to understand what we already have. To plot our businesses on map and find obvious patterns or clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach to solution is to cluster businesses in a city of choice and identify what cluster fit best of all. It may either be a cluster with the most popular venues for food or a cluster having similar parameters but the least vanues for food."
