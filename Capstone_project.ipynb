    "Nowadays, it is difficult to imagine a city without a restaurant or a venue for food where people can have a meal or drink. The city of my choose is Taganrog that is the leading historic, cultural and industrial center in the South of Russia. Local industry and businesses are represented by aerospace, machine-building, military, iron and steel industry, farming, food, theathers, museums and one of the major ports of Azov Sea. That means there are a lot of business opportunities for restaurant business what leads to high competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "To survive in such competitive market it is very important to find right place and take into account many other important factors such as:\n",
    "* City population\n",
    "* Sport And Entertainment zones\n",
    "* Food markets with products of local farmers\n",
    "* Local competitors and their ratings\n",
    "* etc\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce the risks and avoid loss of money, the analysis of all accessible data should be carried out carefully in order to choose a suitable place or location. In my opinion, even an amazing idea or ingenious concept will not make your restaurant business successful without suitable place for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this project will be interesting both for a big company and anyone who wants to open a new restaurant in Taganrog city.\n"
